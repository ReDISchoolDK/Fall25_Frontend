## Week 7: Arrays

## Summary

Arrays are vital for handling lists of data. This week, you’ll learn how to work with arrays in JavaScript and use them to manage dynamic content on your site.

## Tasks

### FreeCodeCamp Lab

- Do the lab [Lunch Picker Program](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/full-stack-developer/lab-lunch-picker-program/build-a-lunch-picker-program)

### Project Work

- Think ahead (no coding required):

  - Sketch the data you’ll need for one pipe pair: x position, gap size, top height, width.
  - Write pseudocode for storing multiple pipes in an array and looping over them to draw.
  - Decide when to spawn a new pipe (time-based or distance-based) and jot it down.

- **Version Control:**
  - Commit your notes to the repo on a small branch (e.g., `week-07-notes`).

- (Optional) Write down any questions you have and bring them to the next class for discussion.
