# Week 08 Loops

**Summary:**  
In Week 8, you will learn about loops in JavaScript. Loops are essential for automating repetitive tasks and iterating over data structures. You will also explore how to use loops effectively in your projects.

**Tasks:**

- **FreeCodeCamp Lab:**

  - Visit the [Build a Factorial Calculator](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/full-stack-developer/lab-factorial-calculator/build-a-factorial-calculator) lab.

- **Project Work:**

  - Setup

    - Create a new project inside your projects folder called `programmatic-art`. Add the usual files and strucure:

      ```
      - `index.html`
      - `styles.css`
      - `script.js`
      ```

    - Add the code from [index.html](./index.html) to your own `index.html` file.
    - Add the code from [script.js](./script.js) to your own `script.js` file.

  - This week we are creating some generative art using loops. The goal is to create a simple program that draws a pattern on the screen using JavaScript and the HTML5 canvas element. Everything is set up with an example in the script.js file. There are just two requirements:

    - Create one for loop that draws something interesting on the canvas.
    - Create one while loop that draws something interesting on the canvas.

    Maybe a spiral, a grid, or something else. Be creative! Can you use user input to change the pattern? Or randomization? It is all up to you!

- **Version Control:**
  - Create a new branch for your new art project feature, and then submit a pull request.
