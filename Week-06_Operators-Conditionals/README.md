# Week 06: Logical Operators and Conditionals

## Summary

This week deepens your JavaScript skills by focusing on logical operators and conditional statements. These concepts are essential for creating dynamic, decision-based features on your website.

## Tasks

- **FreeCodeCamp Lab:**
  - Complete selected lab on [Build a fortune teller](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/full-stack-developer/lab-fortune-teller/build-a-fortune-teller) to train conditional logic and logical operators.
- **Project Work:**

  - Enhance your site with a new project that uses conditionals. Make sure to add it in the same way as you added the `counter` project, with a new folder and all the relevant files.

  Here are some ideas:

  - Create a simple quiz that asks users questions and provides feedback based on their answers.
  - Make a "guess the number" game where users have to guess a number between 1 and 10, and the program gives hints (too high, too low).
  - Change the page of the project based on the current time of day (morning, afternoon, evening).

  Keep it simple and fun! The goal is to practice using conditionals in JavaScript.

- **Version Control:**
  - Create a new branch for your conditional feature, and then submit a pull request.
