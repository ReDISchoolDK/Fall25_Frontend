# Week 06: Logical Operators and Conditionals

## Summary

This week deepens your JavaScript skills by focusing on logical operators and conditional statements. These concepts are essential for creating dynamic, decision-based features on your website.

## Resources
Here are some resources to help you understand logical operators and conditionals in JavaScript. It is not required to go through all of them, but they are good references if you need them or get stuck.
- [MDN JavaScript Conditionals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Control_flow_and_error_handling#conditional_statements)
- [W3 Schools JavaScript If...Else](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_if_else.asp)
- [W3 Schools JavaScript Switch](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_switch.asp)

## Tasks

### FreeCodeCamp Lab 
  - Complete selected lab on [Build a fortune teller](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/full-stack-developer/lab-fortune-teller/build-a-fortune-teller) to train conditional logic and logical operators.

### Project Work

  - Enhance your site with a new project that uses conditionals. Make sure to add it in the same way as you added the `counter` project, with a new folder and all the relevant files.

  There is no set project, just do something small that leverages the skills you have learned.
  Here are some ideas:

  - Create a simple quiz that asks users questions and provides feedback based on their answers.

  - Make a "guess the number" game where users have to guess a number between 1 and 10, and the program gives hints (too high, too low).

  - Change the page of the project based on the current time of day (morning, afternoon, evening) (use the `Date` object with the [getHours method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/getHours)).

  Keep it simple and fun! The goal is to practice using conditionals in JavaScript.

- **Version Control:**
  - Create a new branch for your conditional feature, and then submit a pull request.
