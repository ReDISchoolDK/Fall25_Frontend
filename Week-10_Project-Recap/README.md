# Week 10: Project Work & Recap of Functions and Control Flow

## Summary

Polish, refactor, and stabilize your Flappy Bird game. Focus on readability, small bugs, and small UX improvements.

## Tasks

### Project Work

- Refactor & polish:
  - Clean up function names and magic numbers. Extract constants (gravity, speed, gap).
  - Add a start screen and a game over screen with instructions.
  - Fix at least one bug or edge case (e.g., restart timing, repeated input, overlapping pipes).
  - OR implement one new feature of your choice (e.g., scoring, sound effects, high score tracking - whatever you want).
