- [W3 schools JavaScript functions](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_functions.asp)

## Tasks

### FreeCodeCamp Lab

- Complete the [Build a JavaScript Trivia Bot](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/full-stack-developer/lab-javascript-trivia-bot/lab-javascript-trivia-bot) lab. This lab will help you practice essential JavaScript concepts like declaring variables, writing functions, and using conditional logic.

### Project Work

- Using the template repo, render static sprites on the canvas (no movement yet):
  - create a `flappybird.js` file and link it in `index.html`.
  - Ensure your JS is loaded (e.g., `flappybird.js` referenced from `index.html`).
  - Load and draw the provided images at fixed positions:
    - Background (`flappybirdbg.png`) if not set via CSS.
    - Bird (`flappybird.png`) centered vertically.
    - A pair of pipes (`toppipe.png`, `bottompipe.png`) placed off to the right side.
  - Keep variables simple.

- Version Control
  - Commit with a message like "week-03: draw static bird and pipes" and push.
  - Send a link to your repo to your assigned teacher for feedback in Slack.
