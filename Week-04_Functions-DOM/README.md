# Week 04: Functions and DOM Manipulation

## Summary

This week introduces JavaScript fundamentals with a focus on writing functions and manipulating the DOM. You will learn how to change webpage content dynamically.

## Tasks

You will have two weeks to complete the tasks for this week. So don't worry if you don't finish everything in one week. You can continue working on the tasks next week.

- **FreeCodeCamp Lab:**
  - Complete the [Icon Toggler](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/full-stack-developer/lab-favorite-icon-toggler/build-a-favorite-icon-toggler) lab to practice creating functions and basic DOM manipulation.
- **Project Work:**

  - **Folder Structure:**  
    Add a counter project to your projects folder:
    ```
    src/
      ├── index.html
      ├── styles.css
      ├── script.js
      ├── about/
      │   ├── index.html
      │   ├── styles.css
      │   └── script.js
      └── projects/
          ├── index.html
          ├── styles.css
          ├── script.js
          └── counter/
              ├── index.html
              ├── styles.css
              └── script.js
    ```

  ### Create a Counter

  1.  **Setup the HTML:**
      - In the `counter/index.html` file, create a basic structure with buttons for increasing, decreasing, and resetting the counter. Add a display area for the counter value.
  2.  **Style the Counter:**

      - In the `counter/styles.css` file, add some basic styling for the counter and buttons.

  3.  **Add Functionality:**

      - In the `counter/script.js` file, implement the logic for increasing, decreasing, and resetting the counter.

  4.  BONUS:
      - Add a reset button that resets the counter to zero.

- **Version Control:**

  Next week we will learn how to use branches and pull requests. So just hold off on commiting your work until then.
