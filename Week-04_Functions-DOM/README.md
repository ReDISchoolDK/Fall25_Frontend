# Week 04: Functions and DOM Manipulation

## Summary

This week introduces JavaScript fundamentals with a focus on writing functions and manipulating the DOM. You will learn how to change webpage content dynamically.

## Resources

Here are some resources. It is not required to go through all of them, but they are good references if you need them or get stuck.

- [W3 schools JavaScript & DOM](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom.asp)
- [W3 schools JavaScript DOM Methods](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom_methods.asp)

## Tasks

### FreeCodeCamp Lab

- Complete the [Icon Toggler](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/full-stack-developer/lab-favorite-icon-toggler/build-a-favorite-icon-toggler) lab to practice creating functions and basic DOM manipulation.

### Project Work

- Think ahead (no coding required):

  - Create a new file called `NOTES.md`
  - Write a short plan (3â€“5 bullet points) for how you could move the bird.
  - List the functions you might need (e.g., `draw`, `update`, `onInput`).
  - For each function, write a one-line description of what it will do, step by step

- Version Control
  - Add your plan to `README.md` or a `NOTES.md` and commit it.
  - Send a link to your repo to your assigned teacher for feedback in Slack.
