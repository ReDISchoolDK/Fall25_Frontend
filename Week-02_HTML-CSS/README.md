## Summary

This week, you'll lay the foundation of your website by learning HTML and CSS fundamentals. You will practice structuring your content semantically and applying basic styles to create an attractive homepage.

## Resources

Here are some resources to help you understand the basics of HTML and CSS. It is not required to go through all of them, but they are good references if you need them or get stuck.

## Tasks

### FreeCodeCamp Lab

- Complete the [Build a Recipe Page](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/full-stack-developer/lab-recipe-page/build-a-recipe-page) lab to review HTML elements (headings, paragraphs, lists, images) and basic CSS styling.

### Project Work

- Canvas and layout

  - Open the template and edit `index.html` to ensure there is a `<canvas id="game" width="288" height="512">` element.
  - Add a wrapper/container around the canvas if needed for centering on the page.

- Background styling

  - Create a CSS file called `flappybird.css`, link it, and set a page background color and apply the provided background image (`flappybirdbg.png`) behind the canvas.
  - Keep it simple: no game logic yetâ€”just make the canvas visible and nicely placed.

- Version Control
  - Test your changes using the "Go live" feature in VS Code.
  - Commit your changes with a clear message like "week-02: add canvas + background styling" and push to GitHub.
  - Send a link to your repo to your assigned teacher for feedback in Slack.
