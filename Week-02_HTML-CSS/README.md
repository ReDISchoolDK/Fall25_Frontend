# Week 02: HTML and CSS

**Summary:**  
This week, you'll lay the foundation of your website by learning HTML and CSS fundamentals. You will practice structuring your content semantically and applying basic styles to create an attractive homepage.

**Tasks:**

- **FreeCodeCamp Lab:**
  - Complete the [Build a Recipe Page](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/full-stack-developer/lab-recipe-page/build-a-recipe-page) lab to review HTML elements (headings, paragraphs, lists, images) and basic CSS styling.
- **Project Work:**
  - **Folder Structure:**  
    Set up your project folders as follows:
    ```
    src/
      ├── index.html
      ├── styles.css
      ├── about/
      │   ├── index.html
      │   └── styles.css
      └── projects/
          ├── index.html
          └── styles.css
    ```
  - **Main `index.html`:**
    - Create your main `index.html` file using semantic HTML.
    - Add a `<nav>` element with **two links**:
      - One linking to the About page (`about/index.html`)
      - One linking to the Projects page (`projects/index.html`)
    - Include a `<main>` section for your content and a `<footer>` for additional info.
  - **Styling:**
    - Create a `styles.css` file in the `css/` folder.
    - Link `styles.css` to your `index.html` and apply basic styles (e.g., colors, fonts, margins) to enhance your page’s appearance.
- **Version Control:**
  - Commit your work with a clear message and push to GitHub.
