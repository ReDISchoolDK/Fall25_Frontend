## Tasks
### FreeCodeCamp Lab 
  - Complete the [Build a Recipe Page](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/full-stack-developer/lab-recipe-page/build-a-recipe-page) lab to review HTML elements (headings, paragraphs, lists, images) and basic CSS styling.

### Project Work
  - **Folder Structure:**  
    Set up your project folders as follows:
    ```
    src/
      ├── index.html
      ├── styles.css
      ├── about/
      │   ├── index.html
      │   └── styles.css
      └── projects/
          ├── index.html
          └── styles.css
    ```

  - **Main `index.html`:**
    - Create your main `index.html` file using semantic HTML.
    - Add a `<nav>` element with **two links**:
      - One linking to the About page (`about/index.html`)
      - One linking to the Projects page (`projects/index.html`)
    - Include a `<main>` section for your content and a `<footer>` for additional info.

  - **Styling:**
    - Create a `styles.css` file as indicated in the folder structure.
    - Link `styles.css` to your `index.html` and apply basic styles (e.g., colors, fonts, margins) to enhance your page’s appearance.

- **Version Control:**
  - Commit your work with a clear message and push to GitHub.
