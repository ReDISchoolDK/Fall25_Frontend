# Week 09: Objects

## Summary

This week focuses on JavaScript objects, a fundamental data structure that allows you to store collections of data and more complex entities. You will learn how to create, access, and manipulate objects, which are essential for organizing your code and managing state in your applications.
We will also scope and figure out the final project for the course.

## Tasks

### FreeCodeCamp Lab

- Complete the challenges on [Basic Data Structures: Objects](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-data-structures/) to practice creating and accessing object properties.

### Project Work

This week, we will also decide on the direction for your final project. You have three options to choose from, allowing you to apply the skills you've learned in a way that best suits your interests.

**Concept Summary of the Three Options**

Students choose their final project direction based on how they want to apply their skills:

1.  **Finish and polish Flappy Bird**
    Build on an existing foundation. The focus is on refining, improving, and expanding what already exists—perfect for practicing iteration, debugging, and feature enhancement.

2.  **Create another game**
    Start fresh while staying in a familiar domain. This option encourages creativity, problem-solving, and applying core front-end concepts in a playful, structured way.

3.  **Do something entirely different**
    Explore any front-end idea beyond games. This path supports self-directed learning, personal interests, and experimenting with real-world interfaces or tools.

Together, these options allow students to either deepen an existing project or pursue something new—while demonstrating the full range of skills they’ve learned.

#### Option 1: Flappy Bird Requirements

For those choosing to finish Flappy Bird, here are the requirements for a complete game:

- **Game State Management:**
  - Start screen to begin the game.
  - Game over screen displaying the final score.
  - Ability to restart the game after a game over.
- **Gameplay Mechanics:**
  - Bird flaps when the user interacts (e.g., clicks or presses a key).
  - Pipes are generated continuously and move across the screen.
  - Score increments as the bird successfully passes through pipes.
- **Collision and Scoring:**
  - Collision detection between the bird and pipes.
  - The game ends upon collision.
  - The score is displayed on the screen during gameplay and on the game over screen.
- **Graphics and Animation:**
  - Bird animation (e.g., flapping wings).
  - Drawing order is correct: background -> pipes -> bird.
- **Bonus Features (Optional):**

  - Sound effects for flapping, scoring, and collision.
  - Increasing difficulty over time (e.g., pipes speed up).
