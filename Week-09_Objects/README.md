# Week 09: Objects

**Summary:**  
This week focuses on JavaScript objects, a fundamental data structure that allows you to store collections of data and more complex entities. You will learn how to create, access, and manipulate objects, which are essential for organizing your code and managing state in your applications.
We will also scope and figure out the final project for the course.

**Instructions:**
