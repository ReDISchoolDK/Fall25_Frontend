# Week 05: Event Listeners, Basic Variable Operations, and GitHub Integration

## Summary

In Week 5, you'll boost your site’s interactivity by working with event listeners and basic JavaScript variable operations. You'll also learn best practices for using GitHub (branching and pull requests) to manage your code collaboratively.

## Tasks

### FreeCodeCamp Lab

- No lab this week; focus on drafting your movement plan and practicing Git branching/PRs.

### Project Work

- Think ahead (no coding required):

  - Draft your movement variables and initial values on paper or in a `NOTES.md`.
  - Write pseudocode for the flap action and the per-frame update.
  - Identify at least two edge cases (e.g., hitting the top/bottom, repeated input) and how you’ll handle them.

- **Version Control:**
  - Commit your notes to the repo on a small branch (e.g., `week-05-notes`).
