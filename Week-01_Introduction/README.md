# Week 01: Introduction

## Summary

This week kicks off the course with an introduction to the tools and workflow you’ll use. The goal is to get your development environment ready and learn the basics of version control. You will set up a code editor, create a GitHub repository for your work, and familiarize yourself with using Git to track changes.

**Tasks (In Class):**

- Development Environment: Install VSCode

- GitHub Setup: Fork the starter repo to your own Github account. Clone it to your local machine.

- Git Basics: Go through the freeCodeCamp guide on Learn the Basics of Git (under 10 minutes). Initialize Git in your project folder and make an initial commit (e.g., a README.md introduction). Add all the teacher to your repo as collaborators.

- Hello World Page: Edit the `index.html` in your repo under the `src/` folder with a “Hello, World” message. Open it in your browser to confirm your setup, then add, commit, and push it to GitHub.

## Project Work

Write down a personal, brief plan on what you will do when running into issues throughout the course:

- Who to ask for help (e.g., teachers, classmates, online forums)?
- What resources to consult (e.g., documentation, tutorials, AI), and how to go about that?
 
If you encounter questions during this reflection, bring them to class next week for discussion and to see if your peers have ideas.
