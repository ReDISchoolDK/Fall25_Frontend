# Week 01: Introduction

**Summary:**  
This week kicks off the course with an introduction to the tools and workflow you’ll use. The goal is to get your development environment ready and learn the basics of version control. You will set up a code editor and Node.js, create a GitHub repository for your work, and familiarize yourself with using Git to track changes. By the end of the week, you’ll have a project repository initialized and understand how to push code to GitHub.

**Tasks (In Class):**

- Development Environment: Install VSCode

- GitHub Setup: Fork the starter repo to your own Github account. Clone it to your local machine.

- Git Basics: Go through the freeCodeCamp guide on Learn the Basics of Git (under 10 minutes). Initialize Git in your project folder and make an initial commit (e.g., a README.md introduction). Add all the teacher to your repo as collaborators.

- Hello World Page: Edit the `index.html` in your repo under the `src/` folder with a “Hello, World” message. Open it in your browser to confirm your setup, then add, commit, and push it to GitHub.
