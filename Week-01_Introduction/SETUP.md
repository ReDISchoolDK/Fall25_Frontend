Welcome! This guide will walk you through installing the essential tools, setting up your first project, and making your first Git commit.

If you run into any issues, donâ€™t worry! Just ask your teachers or classmates for help.

## 1. Install Git

Git is the version control system weâ€™ll use to track and share code.

### Windows

1. Go to [Git for Windows download page](https://git-scm.com/download/win).
2. Download and run the installer.
3. During setup, you can accept the default options.
4. After installation, open **Git Bash** (a terminal program installed with Git).

### macOS

1. Open **Terminal** (press `Command + Space`, type "Terminal").
2. Run:
   ```bash
   git --version
   ```
   - If Git is not installed, youâ€™ll be prompted to install **Xcode Command Line Tools**. Accept and wait for installation.

### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)

Run:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git
```

**Verify installation:**

```bash
git --version
```

If you see a version number, Git is installed successfully.

## 2. Install Volta (Node.js Version Manager)

Weâ€™ll use **Volta** to install and manage Node.js.  
Volta makes sure everyone on the team uses the same Node.js and npm versions.

### a. Install Volta

- Go to [Voltaâ€™s official site](https://volta.sh/) and follow the instructions.

**Windows:**

- Download and run the installer from [volta.sh](https://volta.sh/).

**macOS / Linux:**

- Open your terminal and run:
  ```bash
  curl https://get.volta.sh | bash
  ```
- Then restart your terminal.

### b. Install Node.js via Volta

Once Volta is installed, run:

```bashWatch this quick tutorial to understand Git fundamentals:
volta install node
```

This installs the latest stable version of Node.js **and** npm.

> ðŸ’¡ Volta ensures every time you run `node` or `npm`, youâ€™re using the version defined in your project.

## 3. Install Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

- Go to [Visual Studio Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- Download the version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux).
- Install with the default options.
- Open VS Code.

## 4. Create from Template & Clone the Starter Repo

### a. Create _your_ repository from the template

1. Visit: https://github.com/ReDISchoolDK/fe-starter
2. Click **Use this template** â†’ **Create a new repository**.
3. Choose **Owner** (your GitHub account).
4. Name it (e.g., `fe-starter-yourname`), optionally add a description.
5. Leave **Include all branches** unchecked (default is fine).
6. Click **Create repository**.

> Using **Use this template** makes a brand-new repo with the starter files (not a fork).

### b. Clone _your new_ repository to your computer

1. On your new repo page (under **your** account), click **Code** and copy the **HTTPS** URL.
2. Open your terminal (Git Bash or VS Code Terminal), then run:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO-NAME.git
   cd YOUR-REPO-NAME
   ```

## 4. Learn the Basics of Git

### Video Tutorial for using Git in VS Code

Watch this quick tutorial to understand Git fundamentals:

ðŸ‘‰ [Learn Git Basics in VSCode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_23KUAEtUM)

**Core Ideas:**

- **Working Directory** = your files
- **Staging Area** = files youâ€™ve marked with `git add`
- **Repository** = history of your commits

**Essential Commands:**

- `git add .` â†’ stage changes
- `git commit -m "message"` â†’ save snapshot
- `git push` â†’ upload to GitHub

## 5. Initialize Git & Make Your First Commit

In your project folder:

```bash
cd fe-starter
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"
```

Then edit the `index.html` file and commit your changes:

1. Open `src/index.html` in VS Code.
2. Add any text you want (e.g., "Hello, World!").
3. Save the file.
4. Use VS Codeâ€™s Source Control panel to stage, commit, and push your changes:

   - Click the **Source Control** icon on the left sidebar.
   - Click the **+** next to changed files to stage them.
   - Enter a commit message (e.g., "Initial commit with Hello World") and click the checkmark to commit.
   - Click the **...** menu and select **Push** to upload your changes to GitHub.

## 6. Add Collaborators (Teachers)

1. Go to your forked repo on GitHub.
2. Navigate: **Settings â†’ Collaborators (or Manage Access)**.
3. Click **Add collaborator**.
4. Enter your teacherâ€™s GitHub username and send an invite.
